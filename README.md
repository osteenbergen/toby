TOBY: Torrent Streaming Application

A CherryPy Python API Server that uses Libtorrent for torrent streaming.

A mobile friendly frontend, built with AngularJS, should allow you to control the player without needing to stand up.

End Goal:
* Get it working on RaspberryPi

Current Status:
* RaspberryPi worked, but not anymore
* VLC player on laptop works

Bugs:
* A lot
* Only a single browser instance should be used without page reloading
* Sometimes the UI doesn't update after a status change
